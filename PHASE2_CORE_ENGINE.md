## 📊 Compliance Statement

This implementation follows NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1 guidelines for media sanitization:

- ✅ **Clear**: Applies logical techniques to sanitize data in all user-addressable storage locations
- ✅ **Purge**: Applies physical or logical techniques to render Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory techniques
- ✅ **Destroy**: Renders Target Data recovery infeasible using state of the art laboratory techniques and results in the subsequent inability to use the media for storage of data

The engine provides appropriate method selection based on data sensitivity requirements and regulatory compliance needs.
