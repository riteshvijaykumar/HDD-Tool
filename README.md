SafeWipe is a secure, cross-platform data sanitization and verification tool designed 
to comply with NIST SP 800-88 guidelines. It ensures sensitive data is permanently 
erased from storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, removable drives, and mobile devices) 
using industry-standard Clear, Purge, and Destroy methods.

## âœ¨ Features
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS)
- Secure erasure methods:
  - Clear (overwrite)
  - Purge (ATA Secure Erase, NVMe Sanitize, Crypto Erase)
  - Destroy (documentation + workflow support)
- Verification of wipe success (block sampling, crypto key validation)
- Compliance reporting with certificates (JSON/PDF)
- Modern, unified UI with JetBrains Compose Multiplatform
- Rust-powered sanitization engine for maximum security and performance

## ðŸ”’ Compliance
SafeWipe follows the sanitization categories and recommendations of 
**NIST Special Publication 800-88 Rev.1**.
